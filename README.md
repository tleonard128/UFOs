# UFOs
Data Bootcamp Javascript Intro work

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript, css, and html to build a webpage where users could filter on and search for UFO sightings based on date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO.

## Results
### The webpage
The webpage contains all of the data on UFO sightings that Dana had provided to us. It gives the date, place, shape and description of the UFO sightings.

### Filtering
If someone wanted to search for specific UFO sightings, all they would need to do is type into the filter area on the bottom left of the webpage and press enter. This makes it easy to know if you were abducted at any point! Search the last place, day or object shape you remember and maybe we can find out!

## Summary
One of the drawbacks of this new design of the website is if you are typing in a filter that does not match exactly, you will not be able to yield a result. Two ways I would improve this would be to look for specific keys instead of exact words and I would also put in the full state names as an option to filter instead of just the two letter postal code.
